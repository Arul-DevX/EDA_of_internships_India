# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis of Internships in India

##  Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on internship listings scraped from [Internshala.com](https://internshala.com). With over **6,000 internship records**, this project helps students make data-informed decisions when choosing internships that align with their academic schedules and career goals.

##  Problem Statement

To analyze internship opportunities across:
- Locations
- Stipends
- Internship roles
- Full-time job offers (LPA)
- Early application behavior
- Hiring activity (actively hiring vs not)

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand trends in internship duration, pay, and posting frequency  
- Examine the link between stipend and job offer potential  
- Identify top roles, locations, and companies offering high-value internships  
- Offer students insights for choosing better internships without hurting academics

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python (v3.12)
- **Libraries**:  
  - Data Collection: `BeautifulSoup`, `Requests`, `Time`, `Random`, `re`  
  - Data Analysis: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Datetime`  
  - Data Visualization: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook

##  Dataset Summary

- **Source**: Internshala (Web scraped)
- **Size**: `6050 rows √ó 10 columns`
- **Key Columns**: `intern_role`, `company_name`, `hiring_type`, `location`, `stipend_per_month`, `duration`, `job_offer (LPA)`, `early_applicant`, `posted_time`

## üßπ Data Cleaning Steps

- Converted `stipend` and `job_offer` from object to float  
- Cleaned `posted_time` to calculate exact posting dates  
- Handled missing values in `hiring_type`, `early_applicant`, and `duration` using **mode** or **median**  
- Removed `26` duplicate rows  
- Handled outliers using **IQR method**  
- Dropped unnecessary columns: `apply_links`, `posted_time`

## üìà Key Insights (Visualized)

- **Top Roles**: Business Development, Digital Marketing dominate  
- **Top Locations**: Work-from-home > Mumbai > Bangalore > Delhi  
- **Most Common Duration**: 3‚Äì6 months  
- **Stipend Range**: ‚Çπ5,000‚Äì‚Çπ10,000 common; few above ‚Çπ15,000  
- **Job Offer Trends**: Most fall between 2‚Äì4 LPA; High offers are rare  
- **Hiring Behavior**: Over 52% are actively hiring; early application helps visibility but not guaranteed selection  
- **Location vs Pay**: Dubai has highest job offer avg (>9 LPA), followed by Pune, Mumbai
